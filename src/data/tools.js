    tip: "Work through the grits in sequence: 400 to remove material, 600 to refine, 1000 to smooth, 2000+ to polish. Skipping grits leaves scratches that show through paint. Wet sanding from 1000 grit upward gives the cleanest results on plastic.",

Gunpla builders primarily work with lacquer, enamel, and acrylic paints. Each has its own properties, strengths, and thinner requirements.",
